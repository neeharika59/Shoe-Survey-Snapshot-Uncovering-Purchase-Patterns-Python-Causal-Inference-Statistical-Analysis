This project investigates how brand logos influence consumer purchasing decisions, independent of a shoeâ€™s functional attributes. By analyzing user preferences through an experiment, we aimed to determine whether brand recognition alone impacts purchase intent.

Our study tested the hypothesis that the presence of a well-known brand logo significantly sways purchasing decisions. Results showed a statistically significant impact, indicating that brand imagery outweighs intrinsic product qualities in shaping consumer perceptions. Additionally, factors like visual appeal and perceived comfort further influenced purchase intent.

These findings highlight the power of branding in consumer behavior, offering valuable insights for marketing strategies, product positioning, and brand management within the footwear industry.
